# Umotox MP3 & WAV to BCWAV converter.

Using this tool you can easily convert any mp3 or wav file into a bcwav file that is used in Nintendo 3DS custom Themes.
Carefuly read through the .txt files before using Umotox to avoid any errors while using Umotox, thank you!


## How It Works

1. Converts `.mp3` to `.wav` using `ffmpeg`.
2. Converts `.wav` to `.bcwav` using `3DWaves`.
3. Places the final `.bcwav` file in an `output` folder.


## Setup Instructions

1. Download this repository onto your system.
2. Check if `ffmpeg.exe` and `3DWaves` are inside the `tools` folder.
3. Place your `.mp3` or `.wav` files in the root folder (same directory as the script) OR drag-and-drop your `.mp3` or `.wav` file onto the Desktop Shortcut.


## Output

 All `.bcwav` files will be placed in the `output` folder.
