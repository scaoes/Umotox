## 3DWaves Conversion Tool

3DWaves is a completely free-to-use `.wav` to `.bcwav` converting help tool.
This tool is not directly able to convert `.wav` files to `.bcwav`, it is only there to be used to HELP the convertion if there is a code that tells it to.

There is already a tool that supports `.mp3` & `.wav` to `.bcwav` converting using 3DWaves called `Umotox`, which was also developed by me.
Feel free to check it out aswell if you are just looking for a finished converter and not to build one yourself.


## Requirements

3DWaves requires you to have the latest version of Python and Numpy installed. 

You can install python on their official website.

Numpy can be installed in the Windows CMD by using the following command.


## Disclaimer

3DWaves is an open-source tool created for converting standard `.wav` audio into `.bcwav` files, a sound format used on Nintendo 3DS. 
This tool does not use or include any proprietary Nintendo code, and it was developed independently without reverse engineering Nintendo software. 
3DWaves was completely built from Scratch.
